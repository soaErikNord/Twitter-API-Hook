    description: Allows a Consumer application to use an OAuth Request Token to request user authorization. This method fulfills Section 6.2 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow. Desktop applications must use this method (and cannot use GET oauth / authenticate).
      
      Please use HTTPS for this method, and all other OAuth token negotiation steps.

/token:
  post:
      description: Allows a registered application to obtain an OAuth 2 Bearer Token, which can be used to make API requests on an applicationâ€™s own behalf, without a user context. This is called Application-only authentication.

        A Bearer Token may be invalidated using oauth2/invalidate_token. Once a Bearer Token has been invalidated, new creation attempts will yield a different Bearer Token and usage of the previous token will no longer be allowed.

        Only one bearer token may exist outstanding for an application, and repeated requests to this method will yield the same already-existent token until it has been invalidated.

        As with all API v1.1 methods, HTTPS is always required.

        Successful responses include a JSON-structure describing the awarded Bearer Token.

        Tokens received by this method should be cached. If attempted too frequently, requests will be rejected with a HTTP 403 with code 99.
